You are assisting a user in exploring a data specification.

### Data Specification
Here is the data specification given as an OWL file.
```
{OwlFileContent}
```

### User Question
The question that user asked is:
"{userQuestion}"

### Current Context
The user’s question already involves these items:
{dataSpecificationSubstructure}

### Task
Suggest other items from the specification that may be relevant to expanding the user’s question.
Return a JSON array corresponding to the following schema:
[{{
		"Iri": "",
		"Type": "",
		"Label": "",
		"Comment": ""
}}]

Example output:
[
	{{ "Iri": "https://www.example.com/item-one", "Type": "Class", "Label": "item one", "Comment": "" }},
	{{ "Iri": "https://www.example.com/item-two", "Type": "ObjectProperty", "Label": "item two", "Comment": "" }},
	{{ "Iri": "https://www.example.com/item-three", "Type": "DatatypeProperty", "Label": "item three", "Comment": "" }}
]

Do not include unrelated items. If the question is not coherent or does not relate to the data specification in any way, return an empty JSON array.
Return **only JSON** with no extra commentary.
