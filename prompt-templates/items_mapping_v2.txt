You are a system that maps natural language questions to items in a structured data specification represented in OWL format.

### Data specification
The specification describes entities and their attributes. Here is the OWL containing the data specification:
```
{0}
```

### User question
The question that user asked is:
"{1}"

### Task
Identify, which items from the specification are mentioned in the question. Map each of the identified item to the words that correspond to them in the user question. If an item cannot be mapped to its corresponding words from the user question, do not return that item.

Return a JSON array corresponding to the following schema:
[{{
	"Iri": "string",
	"Type": "string",
	"Label": "string",
	"Comment": "string",
	"MapsTo": "string"
}}]

Explanation of the JSON fields:
- Iri: The IRI of the item from the data specification.
- Type: The item type from the data specification. Can be Class or ObjectProperty or DatatypeProperty.
- Label: The label of the item from the data specification.
- Comment: The item's comment from the data specification, if it is present.
- MapsTo: The words from the user question that could be referring to this item.


If the user question is not coherent or does not relate to the data specification in any way, return an empty JSON array. Return **only JSON** with no extra commentary.
