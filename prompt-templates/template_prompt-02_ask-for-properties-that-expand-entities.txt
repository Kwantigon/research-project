Give me properties which I can add to my query to gain more information about the "<ENTITY NAME>" entity. Only use properties available in the semantics description I have given you. Give me only properties, which are not present in my original query.
Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses. Provide the output in the following JSON structure:
{
	"entity name": {
		"property one": "explanation of the property one",
		"property two": "explanation of the property two"
	}
}
An example output:
{
	"subject": {
		"code": "the code of the subject, for example, NSWI999",
		"language": "the language that the subject will be taught in. Can be either Czech or English"
	}
}
