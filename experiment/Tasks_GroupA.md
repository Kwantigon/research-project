## Instructions

1. Work on one question at a time, in order.
2. Before starting each question, start a stopwatch.
3. When you finish writing your query, stop the stopwatch and record the time taken.
4. Record the time taken under each question.
5. Write your query in the space provided.

If you cannot solve a question within ~8 minutes, stop and move on.

If you do not have a stopwatch, you can use an online one.
