**Participants' feedback**

- Can't distinguish between user messages and chatbot's replies because of the UI color scheme.
- It wasn't obvious that the input field for filtering is a text field. Thought it was just a note.
- Data specification exploration is nice.
- SPARQL query takes up too much space.
