Given the semantics for a data specification, give me entities, which play a role in the question given in natural language below. For each of those entities, give me the words from the original question, which map to the entities and give me a short summary for each of them.
Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses. Provide the output in the following JSON structure:
[
	"entityOne": {
		"mapsFrom": "Words from the original question",
		"summary": "Summary for the entity"
	},
	"entityTwo": {
		"mapsFrom": "Words from the original question",
		"summary": "Summary for the entity"
	}
]
An example output:
[
	"person": {
		"mapsFrom": "who",
		"summary": "any member of Homo sapiens, unique extant species of the genus Homo, from embryo to adult"
	},
	"school subject": {
		"mapsFrom": "enrolled in",
		"summary": "field of knowledge defined and organized for teaching in school"
	}
]
