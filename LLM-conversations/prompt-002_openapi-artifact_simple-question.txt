## Short summary

I gave the openapi artifact generated by Dataspecer. I asked a question in natural language and asked ChatGPT to give me the relevant entities.

## Transcript

Give me entities from my data specification that play a role in the question given in natural language.
Using the tool called Dataspecer, I have generated the following artifacts for my data specification. Each artifact is delimited by triple backticks.

To answer the natural language question "Who are the players participating in a tournament that started on the 10th of October 2024?", we can identify the relevant entities from the data specification. The entities that play a role in this question are:

start_time: This entity refers to the start date of the badminton event. The tournament started on the 10th of October 2024, so start_time will be used to match events starting on that date.

participant: This entity refers to the players, groups, or organizations actively participating in the event. To answer the question, the list of participants (i.e., players) is essential.

Thus, the key entities are:

start_time: to filter events starting on 10th October 2024.
participant: to identify the players participating in the event.
