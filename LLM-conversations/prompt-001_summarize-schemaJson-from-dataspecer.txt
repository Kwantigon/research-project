Dataspecer is a tool designed for managing and modeling data specifications. It helps users create structured data schemas from ontologies and export them into various formats such as JSON, XML, and CSV. One of its standout features is that it allows users to build these schemas without writing code, leveraging their own domain ontologies to map out the data.

It is particularly useful for organizations that need to manage complex data structures, generate technical artifacts (e.g., data schemas), and create documentation. Dataspecer is being actively developed by researchers at Charles University and has been used in projects like publishing open data for the Czech Republic’s Ministry of the Interior, utilizing a Semantic Government Vocabulary (SGOV)​

This JSON schema defines the structure for a badminton event, which is part of a broader badminton tournament. It includes several key fields for describing the event and participants.

Key Elements of the Schema:
General Structure:

The schema follows the 2020-12 JSON Schema standard.
It defines the type as object, meaning the badminton event will be an object with several properties.
Required Fields:

"id": A unique identifier for the badminton event, formatted as an IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier).
"type": Specifies the type, which must include or contain the string "badminton event".
Optional Fields:

official_website: An array of strings representing URLs for the official website(s).
prize_money: An array of strings describing the prize money, possibly formatted as currency.
start_time & end_time: Arrays of strings representing the start and end times of the event.
official_name: The official name(s) of the event, represented as an array of strings.
participant: Describes individuals or groups (like teams) participating in the event. Each participant is modeled as an object with its own required properties (id, type, etc.), and can also contain nested objects, such as the participant's country_of_citizenship, which is another object.
event_interval: Describes the periodic interval of the event, which might refer to the frequency or scheduling pattern of such events (e.g., annually).
Nested Structures:
The participant property has nested attributes like id, type, name, and country_of_citizenship. The latter is itself an object with attributes like id, type, and official_name describing a sovereign state.
The schema is highly extensible, allowing for flexible yet structured representation of events and participants, typical in large-scale systems that handle complex data, such as sports tournaments. The use of arrays for many properties (e.g., official_name, prize_money, start_time) indicates support for multiple values per property, which may be useful in cases where an event or entity can have multiple representations.

This schema provides a detailed description of data related to a badminton event at a tournament. In simple terms, here’s what it describes:

Basic Event Information:

The event is identified by a unique ID and a type that specifies it as a "badminton event."
Website Information:

It can include a list of official websites related to the event, like the event's homepage.
Prize Money:

There's a section to include information about the prize money, which can be given in different currencies.
Event Timing:

The schema allows specifying both start time (when the event begins) and end time (when the event finishes or becomes irrelevant).
Official Name:

The official name of the event can be recorded, and it may have multiple names (e.g., names in different languages).
Participants:

The event has participants, who can be individuals or teams. For each participant, several details can be provided, such as:
ID and type: Identifying them uniquely.
Name: The participant's name.
Country of citizenship: This is more complex and includes details like the country’s official name and ID.
Event Interval:

This section can describe how often the event happens or the interval between similar events (e.g., if the event occurs yearly or monthly).
Overall, this schema is designed to capture key aspects of a badminton event, including its identity, timing, participants, and other relevant details, to ensure it can be comprehensively described in a structured format.
