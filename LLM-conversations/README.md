This directory contains conversations from my experiments with ChatGPT.

Each file contains a link to the original conversation, a short summary of what the conversation was about and a transcript - in case the original conversation gets deleted. The transcript is just the copy-pasted prompts and answers without any special formatting.

After the first 5 prompts, my supervisor advised me to give the semantics layer to the LLM instead of the artifacts generated by the Dataspecer tool. The artifacts are all generated from the one underlying semantics layer. For what I want to achieve in this project, it would make more sense to give a reprezentation of the semantics layer to the LLM.

After prompt 013, my supervisor advised me to give RDF reprezentation of the semantics layer, because the LLMs have likely seen a lot of those during training. I was also advised to define a JSON structure for the LLM output.
