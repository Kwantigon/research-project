## Short summary

So far, I have only been inputting artifacts from a single data structure in Dataspecer. Here, I tried to give the schema.json and contextld.json files for two data structures.

I asked the same questions as before

## Transcript

Using the tool called Dataspecer, I have generated the following artifacts for my data specification. Each artifact is delimited by triple backticks. Give me entities from my data specification that play a role in the question given in natural language.
