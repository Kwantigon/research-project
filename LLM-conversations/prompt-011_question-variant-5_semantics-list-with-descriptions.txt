ChatGPT
The provided semantics description does not include specific properties related to the "Start Time" entity. The only context available is that "Start Time" is a property of the "Badminton Tournament" class. Therefore, there are no additional properties you can add to your query to gain more information specifically about the "Start Time" entity itself, as it does not have its own distinct properties in the given data specification.

If you are looking for contextual information related to the tournament, you might consider querying properties of the tournament, such as its End Time or Official Website, which could provide relevant context surrounding the event's timing.
