You are assisting me in exploring a data specification.

### Data specification
Here is the data specification given as an OWL file.
```
{0}
```

### Current question
The question that I asked is:
"{1}"

### Current context
My question already involves these items:
{2}

### Task
Suggest other items from the specification that may be relevant to expanding my current question. Do not suggest items that are already in the current context.
Return a JSON array corresponding to the following schema:
[{{
	"Iri": "string",
	"Type": "string",
	"Label": "string",
	"Comment": "string",
	"Reason": "string",
	"Expands": "string",
	"Summary": "string"
}}]

Explanation of the JSON fields:
- Iri: The IRI of the item from the data specification.
- Type: The item type from the data specification. Can be Class or ObjectProperty or DatatypeProperty.
- Label: The label of the item from the data specification.
- Comment: The item's comment from the data specification, if it is present.
- Reason: Explanation of why the item could be relevant to my current question.
- Expands: Iri of the item from the current context that this suggested item would expand.
- Summary: A brief summary suitable for non-technical end-users describing the purpose and relevance of this item in the context of the specification and the current question.

If the question is not coherent or does not relate to the data specification in any way, return an empty JSON array.  Return **only JSON** with no extra commentary.
