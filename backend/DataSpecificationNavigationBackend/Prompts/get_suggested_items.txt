You are assisting me in exploring a data specification.

### Data specification
Here is the data specification given as an OWL file.
```
{0}
```

### Current question
The question that I asked is:
"{1}"

### Current context
My question already involves these items:
{2}

### Task
Suggest up to 8 additional properties from the specification that could meaningfully expand my question.
Your suggestions should help me refine or extend my query by including related but currently unused elements.

Only suggest items of type `ObjectProperty` or `DatatypeProperty`.
Do not suggest standalone classes.
Every suggestion must include:
- The property itself (ObjectProperty or DatatypeProperty)
- The `DomainClass` of the property
- The `RangeClass` of the property (for ObjectProperty, this is a class; for DatatypeProperty, this is a datatype — return it as a string in `RangeClass.Iri`).

The `DomainClass` and `RangeClass` must always be included, even if they already appear in the current context.

If the suggested property is a `DatatypeProperty`:
- The `Iri` of `RangeClass` must contain the datatype Iri.
- The `Label` of `RangeClass` must contain a user-friendly name of the datatype (e.g., "String", "Integer", "DateTime").
- The `Summary` of `RangeClass` must briefly describe the datatype in the format: "A data value of type xsd:string" (replace with the correct datatype).

Return a JSON array. Each element in the array must be an object with the following fields:

- `Iri` (string): The Iri of the suggested property.
- `Label` (string): The label of the suggested property.
- `Type` (string): The type of the item. Must be either `"ObjectProperty"` or `"DatatypeProperty"`.
- `Summary` (string): A brief, user-friendly summary (3–4 sentences) describing the item in the context of the data specification.
- `Reason` (string): Explanation of why the item could be relevant to my current question.
- `DomainClass` (object):
  - `Iri` (string): The Iri of the domain class.
  - `Label` (string): The label of the domain class.
  - `Summary` (string): A brief, user-friendly summary (3–4 sentences) describing the domain class in the context of the data specification.
- `RangeClass` (object):
  - `Iri`: The Iri of the range class.
  - `Label`: Label of the range class.
  - `Summary`: A brief, user-friendly summary (3–4 sentences) describing the range class in the context of the data specification.

You may include properties whose domain is not present in the current context — but only if they offer a meaningful extension of the user’s question.
If the question is not coherent or does not relate to the data specification in any way, return an empty JSON array.
Do not include unrelated items.Do not include markdown, explanations, or commentary.
Return a **raw JSON array**, and nothing else.
