# Todos and things that I haven't gotten around to

Eventually musím ještě připsat navrhovanou strategii pro každou tady tu věc.

- Could add user configuration, what kind of query to translate to (Sparql or SQL etc.)

- Incoming user message is processed as if it is the first message even if it differs only a slight bit from the suggested message (for example it doesn't have a comma at the end or something similarly silly). There is room for improvement here.

- Specify exactly, what are "items relevant to the current question". I could use a vector database or some other techniques for calculating relevance.

- I'm mapping words from user message to exactly one data specification item. But natural language is naturally ambiguous so one word could mean multiple things. I could maybe display the mapped items to the user and let them pick what they want. They could pick one or more mapped items.

- Add support for data filtering in the Sparql query.

- Select target is mapped only once when mapping to data specification. All suggestions later are treated as nontarget classes. There is room to think about this.

- Lepší mapování MappedWords na user message.
	Při získání suggested message rovnou si říct o mapování. Teď si beru jen suggested message a pak v dalším kroku dělám mapping to substructure.
	Nebo nějak zlepšit prompt.
