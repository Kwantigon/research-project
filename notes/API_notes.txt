Write down the API.
Create dummy DB entities where needed.
Define the LLM interface.
Write a dummy interface implementation.

app.MapGet("/query-expansion-properties", ([FromBody] UserQuery userQuery) => Handler.Get.QueryExpansionProperties(userQuery));
- GET requests should not contain a body.
- If they do, the server should ignore the body.
- How do I send the query to the server then?

I really need to figure out a good way to pass the user's query to the server even when semantically, GET request makes the most sense.
- For now, those GET requests pass it in the query part of the URL.

Every query translation is immediately followed by a request for expansion properties. Therefore it probably makes sense to group both actions into one endpoint.
